    <h2>Objective:</h2>
    <p>
        Fill the grid with numbers from 1 to 9 so that each row, column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
    </p>
    <h2>Rules:</h2>
    <p>
        Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Play:</h2>
    <p>
        Start with an incomplete 9x9 grid.<br>
        Some cells already have numbers in them, which cannot be changed.<br>
        Fill in the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9 by clicking on them and selecting a number from the number pad.<br>
        Ensure each number appears only once in each row, column, and subgrid.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <p>Identify rows, columns, or subgrids with the fewest empty cells first.<br>
        Look for existing numbers to help determine missing numbers.<br>Remember, each number can only appear once in each row, column, and subgrid.</p>
    <h2>Winning:</h2>
    <p>
        You win the game when you successfully fill in all the empty cells with numbers from 1 to 9, following the rules of Sudoku.
